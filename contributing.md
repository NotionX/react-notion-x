## Development

To develop the project locally, you'll need a recent version of Node.js and `pnpm` installed globally.

To get started, clone the repo and run `pnpm` from the root directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NotionX/react-notion-x.git
cd react-notion-x
pnpm
```

This will install dependencies and link all of the local packages together using `lerna`. This includes the example projects which will now point to the local version of your packages.

```bash
pnpm dev
```

This starts compiling the packages into their respective `build` folders

With `pnpm dev` running in one tab, we recommend opening a second tab and navigating to the `examples/minimal` directory.

```bash
cd examples/minimal
pnpm dev
```

Running `pnpm dev` from the `examples/minimal` directory will start the example project's Next.js dev server. This project ill be using your locally built version of the libraries.

You should now be able to open `http://localhost:3000` to view and debug the example project.

### Gotchas

Whenever you make a change to one of the packages, the `pnpm dev` from the project root will re-compile that package, and the `pnpm dev` from the example project's Next.js dev server should hot-reload it in the browser.

Sometimes, this process gets a little out of whack, and if you're not sure what's going on, I usually just quit one or both of the `pnpm dev` commands and restart them.

If you're seeing something unexpected while debugging one of the Next.js demos, try running `rm -rf .next` to refresh the Next.js cache before running `pnpm dev` again.

## Before Pull Request

Before submitting your pull request, please check the following:

1. Run linting:

```bash
pnpm run test:lint
```

If there are any linting errors, please fix them before proceeding with the PR. This helps maintain consistent code quality across the project.

2. Run tests:

```bash
pnpm test
```

Ensure that all the tests pass before submitting your PR. This verifies that your changes don't break existing functionality.

3. Build the project:

```bash
pnpm build
```

Ensure that the project can be built successfully. This confirms that your changes are compatible with the build process.

If all these steps pass, your code is ready for the pull request.
