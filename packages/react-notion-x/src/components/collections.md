# Collection Notes

## TODO

- support row popup
- support row popup and selected view URL params
  - `?v=` and `?p=`
- board and table views scrollable but not necessarily 100% width
- test hiding various properties
- test more advanced collection views

- hash block id in URL should highlight that block
- iframe asset lazy loading show spinner
- some notion users in collections aren't loaded up front
- toggle should remember state in local storage
- for bookmarks, icons, and other image assets, gracefully handle loading errors

### Card

- `coverType: files`
  - for gallery view and board view
