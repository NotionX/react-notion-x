## Advice

If you just want to publish a website using Notion, then we highly recommend using [Super.so](https://s.super.so/x) — a hosted solution with great perf that takes care of all the details for you.

If you want more control over your website via React, then we recommend checking out the accompanying [Next.js starter kit](https://github.com/transitive-bullshit/nextjs-notion-starter-kit), which is free and uses `react-notion-x` under the hood.

And if you want even more control, then you're in the right place! 👇👇

## Features

- 🚀 **Simple** - TypeScript + React
- ⚡ **Fast** - 10-100x faster than Notion
  - 95-100% Lighthouse scores
  - Heavier components can be loaded lazily via `next/dynamic`
- 💯 **Tests** - Comes with a comprehensive [test suite](https://www.notion.so/Notion-Test-Suite-067dd719a912471ea9a3ac10710e7fdf) covering most of Notion's functionality
- 🔥 **Solid** - Used in production by [Potion](https://www.potion.so) and thousands of websites
- 💪 **Smooth** - Supports `next/image` along with LQIP preview images ([demo](https://react-notion-x-demo.transitivebullsh.it/3492bd6dbaf44fe7a5cac62c5d402f06))
- Framework agnostic - Use with next.js, create-react-app, gatsby, etc

## Usage

First you'll want to fetch the content for a Notion page:

```ts
import { NotionAPI } from 'notion-client'

const notion = new NotionAPI()

const recordMap = await notion.getPage('067dd719a912471ea9a3ac10710e7fdf')
```

Once you have the data for a Notion page, you can render it via React:

```tsx
import * as React from 'react'
import { NotionRenderer } from 'react-notion-x'

export default ({ recordMap }) => (
  <NotionRenderer recordMap={recordMap} fullPage={true} darkMode={false} />
)
```

Note: for heavier blocks, you'll have to opt into using them via `NotionRenderer.components`. These are not included in the default `NotionRenderer` export because they're too heavyweight for many use cases.

## Styles

You'll need to import some CSS styles as well. If you're using Next.js, we recommend you place these imports at the top of `pages/_app.js`:

```ts
// core styles shared by all of react-notion-x (required)
import 'react-notion-x/src/styles.css'

// used for code syntax highlighting (optional)
import 'prismjs/themes/prism-tomorrow.css'

// used for rendering equations (optional)
import 'katex/dist/katex.min.css'
```

## Optional Components

The default imports from `react-notion-x` strive to be as lightweight as possible. Most blocks will render just fine, but some larger blocks like PDFs and collection views (database views) are not included by default.

To use them, you'll need to import the ones you want from `react-notion-x/build/third-party/*`:

```tsx
import { Code } from 'react-notion-x/build/third-party/code'
import { Collection } from 'react-notion-x/build/third-party/collection'
import { Equation } from 'react-notion-x/build/third-party/equation'
import { Modal } from 'react-notion-x/build/third-party/modal'
import { Pdf } from 'react-notion-x/build/third-party/pdf'
```

Note that we strongly recommend lazy-loading these components unless you know you'll need them up front for your use case.

If you're using Next.js, you can use [next/dynamic](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/dynamic-import) to lazily load them. If your notion content doesn't use one of these heavyweight components, then it won't get loaded into your page. This keeps the initial page bundle small and your website feeling snappy.

```tsx
import dynamic from 'next/dynamic'

const Code = dynamic(() =>
  import('react-notion-x/build/third-party/code').then((m) => m.Code)
)
const Collection = dynamic(() =>
  import('react-notion-x/build/third-party/collection').then(
    (m) => m.Collection
  )
)
const Equation = dynamic(() =>
  import('react-notion-x/build/third-party/equation').then((m) => m.Equation)
)
const Pdf = dynamic(
  () => import('react-notion-x/build/third-party/pdf').then((m) => m.Pdf),
  {
    ssr: false
  }
)
const Modal = dynamic(
  () => import('react-notion-x/build/third-party/modal').then((m) => m.Modal),
  {
    ssr: false
  }
)
```

You'll need to enable them by passing them to the `components` prop of `NotionRenderer`.

```tsx
export default ({ recordMap }) => (
  <NotionRenderer
    recordMap={recordMap}
    components={{
      Code,
      Collection,
      Equation,
      Modal,
      Pdf
    }}
  />
)
```

The `Code` component uses [Prism]() under the hood. It comes bundled with support for JavaScript, TypeScript, and CSS by default. To add support for additional language syntaxes, follow the example in [`components/NotionPage.tsx`](./examples/full/components/NotionPage.tsx) which lazily loads Prism components at runtime.

For `Equation` support, you'll need to import the katex CSS styles.

For each of these optional components, make sure you're also importing the relevant third-party CSS if needed ([above](#Styles)).

## Private Pages

You may optionally pass an `authToken` and `activeUser` to the API if you want to access private Notion pages. Both can be retrieved from your web browser. Once you are viewing your workpace, open your Development Tools > Application > Cookie > and Copy the `token_v2` and `notion_user_id`. Respectively, activeUser: notion_user_id, authToken: token_v2.

We recommend storing these as environment variables and passing them into the `NotionAPI` constructor as follows:

```tsx
const notion = new NotionAPI({
  activeUser: process.env.NOTION_ACTIVE_USER,
  authToken: process.env.NOTION_TOKEN_V2
})
```

Note that this is not the same as the API token provided by the official Notion API since `notion-client` uses the unofficial Notion API (which is what all Notion apps use).

## Next.js Examples

Here's a [minimal Next.js example project](./examples/minimal) with the most important code in [`pages/[pageId].tsx`](./examples/minimal/pages/%5BpageId%5D.tsx) and [`components/NotionPage.tsx`](./examples/minimal/components/NotionPage.tsx). You can view this example [live on Vercel](https://react-notion-x-minimal-demo.transitivebullsh.it).

Here's a more [full-featured Next.js example project](./examples/full) with the most important code in [`pages/[pageId].tsx`](./examples/full/pages/%5BpageId%5D.tsx) and [`components/NotionPage.tsx`](./examples/full/components/NotionPage.tsx). You can view this example [live on Vercel](https://react-notion-x-demo.transitivebullsh.it).

The full-featured demo adds a few nice features:

- Uses [next/image](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/image) to serve optimal images
- Uses preview images generated via [lqip-modern](https://github.com/transitive-bullshit/lqip-modern)
- Lazily bundles larger optional components via [next/dynamic](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/dynamic-import)
  - Code
  - Equation
  - Pdf
  - Modal
  - Collection (e.g., notion databases including table and gallery views)

For a production example, check out the [Next.js Notion Starter Kit](https://github.com/transitive-bullshit/nextjs-notion-starter-kit), which uses `react-notion-x` under the hood.

## Performance

Out of the box, `react-notion-x` is pretty fast and relatively lightweight, but there are a few key factors to be aware of.

Bundlephobia reports a [~27kb gzip bundle size](https://bundlephobia.com/result?p=react-notion-x) for the main `react-notion-x` bundle. This doesn't include the optional `third-party` components which we recommend lazy loading via [next/dynamic](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/dynamic-import) only if a page needs them.

Another major factor for perf comes from images hosted by Notion. They're generally unoptimized, improperly sized, and not cacheable because Notion has to deal with fine-grained access control that users can change at any time. You can override the default `mapImageUrl` function on `NotionRenderer` to add caching via a CDN like Cloudflare Workers, which is what Notion X does for optimal page load speeds.

`NotionRenderer` also supports lazy image loading with optional low quality image placeholder previews. You can see a demo of this in practice [on this page](https://react-notion-x-demo.transitivebullsh.it/3492bd6dbaf44fe7a5cac62c5d402f06) which is using [lqip-modern](https://github.com/transitive-bullshit/lqip-modern) to pre-generate placeholder images that are inspired by Medium.com's image loading.

If you're using Next.js, we recommend passing `next/image` and `next/link` to the renderer as follows:

```tsx
import Image from 'next/image'
import Link from 'next/link'

export default ({ recordMap }) => (
  <NotionRenderer
    recordMap={recordMap}
    components={{
      nextImage: Image,
      nextLink: Link
    }}
  />
)
```

This wraps these next.js components in a compatability layer so `NotionRenderer` can use them the same as their non-next.js equivalents `<img>` and `<a>`.


## Calendar view
Notion's databases calendar view is one of the most complex views that exists on Notion.
This component is still a Work-In-Progress, **recommended use is for development only**, but will soon be more stable and out of bugs and ready for production deploys.

At the moment it features:
- Controls (previuous, current, next month views)
- Display block that has ONLY one day duration (without time)
- Show calendar in both SUN-SAT and MON-SUN format (use `startWeekOnMonday` parameter)

What is unsupported at the moment:
- Display blocks that has a day range
- Display blocks with date and time (it will render but the data and time property will be shown in a bad way)
