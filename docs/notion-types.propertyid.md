## PropertyID type

Unique identifier for collection properties representing the columns in a traditional relational database.

Either a 4-character hash like `o;Os` or `title` as a special, reserved property ID for collection title properties.

You can think of `title` properties as primary indexes that are guaranteed to exist as in a traditional database.
